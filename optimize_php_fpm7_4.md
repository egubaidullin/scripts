# PHP-FPM Optimization Script

## Description

This script is designed to help optimize PHP-FPM configurations by analyzing current system resource usage and PHP-FPM settings. It provides recommendations for the `pm.max_children` setting based on available system RAM and the average size of PHP-FPM child processes. Additionally, it suggests values for `pm.start_servers`, `pm.min_spare_servers`, and `pm.max_spare_servers` based on the number of CPU cores. This script is intended for systems running PHP 7.4.

## Features

- Checks for `max_children` reached errors in PHP-FPM logs.
- Retrieves current `pm.max_children` and other related settings from the PHP-FPM configuration.
- Calculates total available RAM and average PHP-FPM child process size.
- Suggests optimal PHP-FPM `pm.*` settings based on system resources.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have sudo privileges or run as the root user.
2. Save the script as `optimize_php_fpm.sh`.
3. Make the script executable: `chmod +x optimize_php_fpm7_4.sh`.
4. Run the script: `./optimize_php_fpm7_4.sh`.

## Output

The script will output:
- Total system RAM.
- Average size of PHP-FPM child processes.
- Number of CPU cores.
- Recommended settings for `pm.max_children`, `pm.start_servers`, `pm.min_spare_servers`, and `pm.max_spare_servers`.

## Note

- This script is specifically for PHP 7.4 FPM running on Linux.
- Adjustments to the PHP-FPM configuration file (`/etc/php/7.4/fpm/pool.d/www.conf`) based on the script's recommendations should be done carefully and with understanding of the potential impact on your specific environment.
- Always backup your configuration files before making changes.
